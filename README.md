## <a name="Concepts"></a>Concepts

This .NET library wraps the ProfitBricks SOAP API. All API operations are performed over SSL and authenticated using your ProfitBricks portal credentials. The API can be accessed within an instance running in ProfitBricks or directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and receive an HTTPS response. 

## <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started

Before you begin you will need to have [signed-up](https://www.profitbricks.com/signup) for a ProfitBricks account. The credentials you setup during sign-up will be used to authenticate against the API.
 
### Installation

The official .NET library is available from the ProfitBricks GitHub account found [here](https://github.com/profitbricks/profitbricks-sdk-net). You can download the latest stable version by cloning the repository and then adding the project to your solution.
	
Or you can add the SDK by using nuget:

	Install-Package ProfitBricksSDK

### Configuration

Depending on the type of project, you will need to create either an App.config or Web.config file to interact with the service before you begin. This file should contain the following values: 

```sh
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="UserName" value="[Your User Name]"/>
    <add key="Password" value="[Your Password]"/>
  </appSettings>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <bindings>
      <basicHttpBinding>
        <binding name="ProfitBricksProxy.ProfitbricksApiServicePortType">
          <security mode="Transport">
            <transport clientCredentialType="Basic" proxyCredentialType="None" realm="" />
            <message clientCredentialType="UserName" algorithmSuite="Default" />
          </security>
        </binding>
    </bindings>
    <client>
      <endpoint address="https://api.profitbricks.com/1.3" binding="basicHttpBinding"
          bindingConfiguration="ProfitBricksProxy.ProfitbricksApiServicePortType" contract="ProfitBricksProxy.ProfitbricksApiServicePortType"
          name="ProfitBricksProxy.ProfitbricksApiServicePortType" />
    </client>
  </system.serviceModel>
</configuration>
```

### Using the Driver

Here is a simple example on how to use the library.

List all data centers: 

     var dcs = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Get();
    
This will list all virtual data centers you have under your account.

### Additional Documentation and Support

You can engage with us in the community and we'll be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. 

## <a name="CreateDataCenter"> </a>How to: Create a Data Center

ProfitBricks introduces the concept of data centers. These are logically separated from one and the other and allow you to have a self-contained environment for all servers, volumes, networking, snapshots, and so forth. The goal is to give you the same experience as you would have if you were running your own physical data center.

You are required to have a data center created before you can create any other objects. Think of the data center as a bucket in which all objects, such as servers and volumes, live. 

The following code example shows you how to programmatically create a data center: 

	using ProfitBricks.Client;
	using ProfitBricks.POCO.Requests;

	namespace ProfitBricksExample
	{
		class Program
		{
			static void Main(string[] args)
			{
				var dcCreateRequest = new CreateDataCenterRequest
				{
					DataCenterName = "test",
					Location = ProfitBricks.POCO.Enums.Location.uslas
				};

				var dcCreateResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Create(dcCreateRequest);

			}
		}
	}

## <a name="DeleteDataCenter"></a>How to: Delete a Data Center

You will want to exercise a bit of caution here. Removing a data center will **destroy** all objects contained within that data center -- servers, volumes, snapshots, and so on. The objects -- once removed -- will be unrecoverable. 

The following is an example on how to remove the data center created above:

    ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Delete(dcCreateResponse.Id);

## <a name="CreateServer"></a>How to: Create a Server

The following example illustrates how you would create a server and assign it an OS, cores, and memory. We urge you to check the [documentation](https://devops.profitbricks.com/api/soap/) to see the complete list attributes available.

	var serverCreateRequest = new CreateServerRequest
	{
		DataCenterId = dcCreateResponse.Id,
		AvailabilityZone = AvailabilityZone.AUTO,
		Cores = 4,
		InternetAccess = true,
		OsType = OsType.WINDOWS,
		Ram = 256
	};

	var serverCreateResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Create(serverCreateRequest);

One of the unique features of the ProfitBricks platform when compared with the other providers is that it allows you to define your own settings for cores, memory, and disk size without being tied to a particular size.  

## <a name="UpdateServer"></a>How to: Update Cores, Memory, and Disk

ProfitBricks allows users to dynamically update cores, memory, and disk independently of each other. This removes the restriction of needing to upgrade to the next size up to receive an increase in memory. You can now simply increase the instances memory keeping your costs in-line with your resource needs. 

The following code illustrates how you can update cores and memory: 

	var updateServerRequest = new UpdateServerRequest 
	{ 
		ServerId = serverCreateResponse.Id, 
		ServerName = "newName", 
		Cores = 3, Ram = 512 
	};
	
	ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Update(updateServerRequest);

## <a name="DetachReattachStorageVolume"></a>How to: Detach and Reattach a Storage Volume

ProfitBricks allows for the creation of multiple storage volumes. You can detach and reattach these on the fly. This allows for various scenarios such as re-attaching a failed OS disk to another server for possible recovery, move a volume to another location and re-attaching to a different server and spinning it up. 

The following illustrates how you would attach a volume and then detach it from a server:

	//First we need to create a volume.
	var createVolumeRequest = new CreateVolumeRequest
	{
		DataCenterId = dcCreateResponse.Id,
		Size = 1
	};

	var createVolumeResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.Create(createVolumeRequest);
	
	//Then we are going to attach the newly volume to a server.
	var connectStorageRequest = new ConnectStorageRequest
	{
		ServerId = createServerResponse.Id,
		StorageId = createVolumeResponse.Id,
		BusType = BusType.SCSI,
	};

	ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.ConnectVolume(connectStorageRequest);

	//Here we are going to detach it from the server.
	ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.DisconnectVolume(createVolumeResponse.Id, createServerResponse.Id);

## <a name="ListServersVolumesDataCenters"></a>How to: List Servers, Volumes, and Data Centers

You can pull various resource lists from your data centers using the .NET library. The three most common resources are data centers, Servers, and Volumes.

The following code illustrates how to pull these three list types: 

	var dcs = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Get();
	var servers = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Get();
	var volumes = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.Get();

## <a name="CreateNic"></a>How to: Create Additional Network Interfaces

The ProfitBricks platform supports adding multiple NICs to a server. These NICs can be used to create different, segmented networks on the platform.
The sample below shows you how to add a second NIC to an existing server: 

	var createNicRequest = new CreateNicRequest 
	{ 
		ServerId = createServerResponse.Id, 
		NicName = "new nic name", 
		DhcpActive = true 
	};

	ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Nics.Create(createNicRequest);

One item to note is this function will result in the server being rebooted. 

## <a name="Example"></a> Example

	using ProfitBricks.Client;
	using ProfitBricks.POCO.Enums;
	using ProfitBricks.POCO.Requests;

	namespace ProfitBricksExample
	{
		class Program

			static void Main(string[] args)
			{
				// CreateDataCenterRequest. 
				// The only required field is DataCenterName. 
				// If location parameter is left empty data center will be created in the default region of the customer
				var dcCreateRequest = new CreateDataCenterRequest
				{
					DataCenterName = "test",
					Location = ProfitBricks.POCO.Enums.Location.uslas
				};

				// Response will contain Id of a newly created data center.
				var dcCreateResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Create(dcCreateRequest);

				// CreateServerRequest. 
				// DataCenterId: Defines the data center wherein the server is to be created.
				// AvailabilityZone: Selects the zone in which the server is going to be created (AUTO, ZONE_1, ZONE_2).

				// response will contain Id of a newly created server.
				var createServerResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Create(serverCreateRequest);

				// UpdateServerRequest
				// ServerId: Id of the server to be updated.
				// ServerName: Renames target virtual server
				// Cores: Updates the amount of cores of the target virtual server
				// Ram: Updates the RAM memory (in MiB) of the target virtual server. The minimum RAM size is 256 MiB
				var updateServerRequest = new UpdateServerRequest
				{
					ServerId = createServerResponse.Id,
					ServerName = "newName",
					Cores = 3,
					Ram = 512
				};

				ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Update(updateServerRequest);

				// CreateVolumeRequest
				// DataCenterId: Defines the data center wherein the storage is to be created. If left empty, the storage will be created in a new data center
				// Size: Storage size (in GiB). Required Field.
				var createVolumeRequest = new CreateVolumeRequest
				{
					DataCenterId = dcCreateResponse.Id,
					Size = 1
				};

				// Response will contain Id of a newly created volume.
				var createVolumeResponse = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.Create(createVolumeRequest);

				// ConnectStorageRequest
				// ServerId: Identifier of the target virtual storage. Required field.
				// StorageId: Identifier of the virtual storage to be connected. Required field.
				// BusType: Bus type to which the storage will be connected
				var connectStorageRequest = new ConnectStorageRequest
				{
					ServerId = createServerResponse.Id,
					StorageId = createVolumeResponse.Id,
					BusType = BusType.SCSI,
				};

				ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.ConnectVolume(connectStorageRequest);

				ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.DisconnectVolume(createVolumeResponse.Id, createServerResponse.Id);

				// Fetches list of all Data Centers
				var dcs = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.DataCenters.Get();

				// Fetches list of all Servers
				var servers = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Servers.Get();

				// Fetches list of all Volumes
				var volumes = ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Volumes.Get();

				// CreateNicRequest
				// Identifier of the target virtual server. Required field.
				// NicName: Names the NIC
				// Toggles usage of ProfitBricks DHCP
				var createNicRequest = new CreateNicRequest
				{
					ServerId = createServerResponse.Id,
					NicName = "new nic name",
					DhcpActive = true
				};

				ProfitBricksSoapClient.Instance.Nics.Create(createNicRequest);
			}
		}
	}
